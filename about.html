                My name is Shohruz Junaidov, and I am a first-generation student studying Management Information Systems (MIS) at the University of Oklahoma. I was born in Tajikistan, a small country in Central Asia.

                I am proud to say that I have been able to pursue my dreams thanks to the support of organizations like UWC Dilijan and the University of Oklahoma. I received a full scholarship to attend UWC Dilijan in Armenia, where I had the opportunity to study alongside students from around 90 countries and learn about different cultures. After completing my studies at UWC Dilijan, I was fortunate enough to receive another full scholarship to study at the University of Oklahoma, where I am currently pursuing my degree in MIS.

                Aside from my academic pursuits, I am also passionate about sports, music, and community service. I have won two volleyball intramural championships and currently play intramural soccer. I also enjoy playing badminton, chess, and table tennis in my free time. Additionally, I have a love for music and have taught myself how to play the guitar, allowing me to perform at events and share my passion with others.

                As a member of the Multicultural Business Program, I have had the opportunity to network with different companies and meet motivated students in my area. I also work as a Community Assistant in Traditions Square, where I help students navigate campus life and connect with available resources. Through this role, I have been able to make a positive impact on the lives of many international and out-of-state students. Furthermore, I am an active member of several clubs on campus, including the Muslim Students Association, Investment Club, MIS Student Association, OU Venture Capital Club, OU Chess Club, and OU Table Tennis Club
