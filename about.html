               Hello! I am Shohruz, a dedicated and ambitious student at the University of Oklahoma, majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) with an MS in Management Information Technology. Expected to graduate in May 2025, I am highly passionate about leveraging technology to solve business problems.

I bring a solid foundation in technology and business, with specialized coursework in Business Programming Languages, Databases, Business Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Business Process Automation & AI, Managing ERP Systems, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, etc.

Currently, I'm part of Deloitte Consulting's prestigious Apprenticeship Program, where I'm gaining invaluable insights into consulting, particularly in SAPs, and honing my skills through interaction with seasoned consultants. Concurrently, I'm contributing as a Special Services Intern at American Fidelity Assurance Company, focusing on data integrity and validation projects to ensure accuracy and consistency in technical team outputs.

At the University of Oklahoma, I've been recognized on the President's and Dean's Honor Roll, received the PACE Award in 2022, and actively participate in various organizations, including serving as the Vice President of OU ASA and Director of Operations for the OU Futsal Club.

I've successfully managed projects like the development of a comprehensive Car Dealership Management System, enhancing operations with a focus on inventory and ownership tracking, and contributed to creating a custom database for Sonner Tire Company, significantly improving their operational efficiencies.

Fluent in Tajik, Persian, English, and Russian, I bring a global perspective to my work and am committed to making a positive impact through technology and innovation.
