               Hello! I am Shohruz, a dedicated and ambitious student at the University of Oklahoma, pursuing a BBA in Management Information Systems (MIS) alongside an MS in Management Information Technology. Expected to graduate in May 2025, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve business challenges.

I bring a strong foundation in technology and business, with specialized coursework in Business Programming Languages, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Business Process Automation. My professional experience spans internships at Midland Mortgage and American Fidelity Assurance, where I contributed to projects involving data analysis, automation, and improving technical processes.

At Midland Mortgage, I developed an extensive framework using Python, MS Access, and VBA to evaluate loan pools, significantly supporting the company's live bidding processes. Additionally, I rotated across various teams, gaining exposure to automation, forecasting, and data-driven decision-making.

At the University of Oklahoma, I’ve been recognized on the President's and Dean’s Honor Roll and received the prestigious PACE Award, which acknowledges 1% of the freshman class for outstanding participation, academic achievement, community involvement, and leadership excellence. I also serve as Vice President of OU ASA and Director of Operations for the OU Futsal Club.

Fluent in Tajik, Persian, English, and Russian, I bring a global perspective to every project and am committed to driving innovation and making a positive impact through technology.
