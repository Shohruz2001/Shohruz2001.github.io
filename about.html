                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am Shohruz, a dedicated and ambitious student at the University of Oklahoma, pursuing a BBA in Management Information Systems (MIS) alongside an MS in Management Information Technology. Expected to graduate in May 2025, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve business challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Tajikistan and completed my high school education at UWC Dilijan in Armenia, where I studied with students from over 85 countries and earned my International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma. This diverse environment helped shape my global perspective and fostered my commitment to collaborative problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My professional experience spans internships at Midland Mortgage and American Fidelity Assurance, where I contributed to projects involving data analysis, automation, and improving technical processes. At Midland Mortgage, I developed an extensive framework using Python, MS Access, and VBA to evaluate loan pools, significantly supporting the company's live bidding processes.

                <p>
                    At the University of Oklahoma, I’ve been recognized on the President's and Dean’s Honor Roll and received the prestigious PACE Award, which acknowledges 1% of the freshman class for outstanding participation, academic achievement, community involvement, and leadership excellence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fluent in Tajik, Persian, English, and Russian, I bring a global perspective to every project and am committed to driving innovation and making a positive impact through technology.
